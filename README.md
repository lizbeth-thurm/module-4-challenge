# Project Title

Module 4 Challenge

## Description

This is the fourth project in the University of Texas
at Austin Coding Bootcamp.  In this project, students have been
tasked with creating code to run a quiz in a browser.  The quiz
has a timer and the user loses time if they miss a question.
When the user finishes the quiz or runs out of time, whichever
happens first, the game ends and the user's score is entered 
into a high score list.  The user is able to view the high
score list and clear it.
